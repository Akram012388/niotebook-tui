# Implementation Plans

Phased implementation plans for Niotebook development.

## Plans

| Plan | Status | Date | Description |
|------|--------|------|-------------|
| [[2026-02-16-mvp-implementation\|MVP Implementation]] | Active | 2026-02-16 | Full MVP build: server + TUI + database, 24 tasks across 7 phases |

## Plan Structure

Each plan follows a consistent format:
- **Phases** group related tasks
- **Tasks** are self-contained units with TDD steps
- **Steps** are bite-sized actions (write test → run → implement → verify → commit)
- Exact file paths, code, commands, and expected output for every step
- Dependency graph showing which tasks can be parallelized
